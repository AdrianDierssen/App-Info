A community sourced information store about applications.

[<img src="media/App-Info.png" alt="App-Info logo" width="300" />](media/App-Info.png)

This repository is a community-based documentation store for information about applications.  The intended audience of this documentation is for IT Professionals that prepare, deploy, test, and debug applications that they get from vendors.  The goal is to share common information that will be useful to perform those tasks.

As a community project, we do not expect (but will welcome) involvement of the vendors that produce these applications.  Although some of the information on this repository might not be in alignment with the marketing or other goals of the vendor, code-of-conduct rules exist that contributors must agree to.

This community project welcomes all contributors. **By participating you are agreeing to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).**
