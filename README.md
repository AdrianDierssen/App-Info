# App-Info
A community sourced information store about applications.

[<img src="media/App-Info.png" alt="App-Info logo" width="300" />](media/App-Info.png)

This repository is a community-based documentation store for information about applications.  The intended audience of this documentation is for IT Professionals that prepare, deploy, test, and debug applications that they get from vendors.  The goal is to share common information that will be useful to perform those tasks.

As a community project, we do not expect (but will welcome) involvement of the vendors that produce these applications.  Although some of the information on this repository might not be in alignment with the marketing or other goals of the vendor, code-of-conduct rules exist that contributors must agree to.  We want to be positive!

This community project welcomes all contributors. **By participating you are agreeing to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).**  To add a new application, see [Template](/Templates).

**Issues should be filed ONLY if you plan to submit a pull request to fix it.**

**Please use the Disuccsions are (rather than issues) to dicuss topics like:**

* I'd like to see information on this app (but I'm too lazy to add it in myself).
* I'd like to know how to do X on this app.
* This looks wrong, and why it looks wrong and what it should look like.


NOTE: You can always type the letter 't' to enable folder/file search.  Just type 't' and enter the name of the app you want!
