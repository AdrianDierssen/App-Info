# Templates for adding a new application.

When you add a new app into this repository, you will need to do the following:
* Create a folder for the app (possibly under a folder for the vendor if they have multiple apps).
* Create a ReadMe.md file for the app from this template file.
* Create an InstallConfigure.md file from that template.
* Create a Testing.md file from that template.
* Create one or more Packaging-XXX.md files documenting how you packaged that app and the test results.  Test Results are also summarized in the ReadMe.md file for the app.
* Upload a logo file into the media/AppIcons folder.  This should be a 44x44bit png file.

The purpose of the App ReadMe file is to be the initial page viewed when someone looks for information on this application. It defines:
* The vendor, app, and version, along with a link to the vendor website.
* The types of installers available from the vendor.
* Whether the app stores configuration in file or registry, or may be configured externally.
* A summary of the results from any technology-specific repackage testing that was done (each reported result needs a separate Packaging-XXX file).

This folder contains template files that you can use as a base content to copy into your new file.
