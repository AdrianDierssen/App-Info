# Capture Filters

In addition to application specific information, we'd like to gather the collective wisdom of the community on setting up capture filters and package cleanup.

This is the highest level folder for information on setting up application capture filters.

Please use appropriate subfolders to add your own submissions.  It is important not only to document the items we typically want cleaned out of repackaging efforts, but to:

* Document what the thing(s) is/are being removed.
* Why it isn't needed.
* Any special situations where it should not be removed.
