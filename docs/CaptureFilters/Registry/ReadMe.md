# Capture Filters: Registry

This is the folder for information on setting up application capture filters for Registry keys and items.

Please use appropriate subfolders to add your own submissions.  It is important not only to document the items we typically want cleaned out of repackaging efforts, but to:

* Document what the thing(s) is/are being removed.
* Why it isn't needed.
* Any special situations where it should not be removed.
