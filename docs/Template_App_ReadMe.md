## Repackaging Summary

This is where to list a summary of known success (or not) in repackaging info certain formats.  If repackaging the application is not straightforward, a specific documentation file covering the details for that repackaging format is suggested. Values in the Success field are somewhat subjective, but we recommend that the summary use the following value:

* [<img src="/media/CatFullFidelity.png" alt="Full Fidelity" />](/media/CatFullFidelity.png) - App appears to be completly functional.
* [<img src="/media/CatHighConfidence.png" alt="High Confidence" />](/media/CatHighConfidence.png) - There may be a small loss in functionality, but most companies will be OK with deploying this form.
* [<img src="/media/CatMostlyWorks.png" alt="Mostly Works" />](/media/CatMostlyWorks.png) - A loss in functionality that likely makes this a bad way to deploy.
* [<img src="/media/CatIssues.png" alt="Has Issues" />](/media/CatIssues.png) - Application is known to not work in this form (so far).
* [<img src="/media/CatUnknown.png" alt="Unknown/Untested" />](/media/CatUnknown.png) - No information is available.
