# Packaging ActivePython for MSIX

The app has been packaged in MSIX with the PSF.

* PsfLauncher is required for some of the shortcuts.
* The FRF is needed for the developer to configure their environment.

Testing on Windows 10/11 indicates ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Major%20Issues-critical?style=for-the-badge) that make this application a bad candidate at this time.  

* The issues seem to come from the Microsoft MSIX Packaging Tool, so perhaps repackaging using a different vendor might help.
* It might be necessary to force the install to Program Files, however this was not attempted.
