# Testing Avogadro

The following tests should be considered to determine the application fidelity when repackaging.

* Two shortcuts should be present (unless the vendor url is intentionally removed).
* Launch primary app from shortcut.  Open a test file.
* Open a test .cml file from explorer right-click menu.
* If website url shortcut is present, test it.
