# Testing Blender

The following tests should be considered to determine the application fidelity when repackaging.

* Installation and Testing must be performed on a machine with a GPU. Virtual Machines without a GPU will give an error at start and refuse to run.
One shortcut should be present.
* Launch primary app from shortcut.  Dismiss the opening menu, click on the cube and move it around or rotate it. Close without saving.
* Open a previously created .blend file using the FTA in Explorer.  Click `Render-->View Animation` in the menu.  Close once the animation starts.
