# Packaging Calibre for MSIX

The software was packaged on Windows 10 21H2 using Microsoft MSIX Packaging Tool 1.2022.330 and enhanced by editing with TMEditX to inject the PSF.
* PsfLauncher is required for the two 'extra' shortcuts.
* While there are xml files in the package, these are not modified so the FRF is not recommended.
