# Testing Anaconda

The following tests should be considered to determine the application fidelity when repackaging.

* Six shortcuts should be present (unless some are intentially removed).
* Launch Anaconda Prompt.
* Launch Navigator. Check preference for disable dialog on close.  Then make a change, close and reopen app to test stickyness of the change.
* Launch Spyder. Make sure it doesn't tell you about an update.
* Launch Jupiter.
