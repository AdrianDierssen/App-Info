# Installation and Configuration Notes for DosBox_Blockout

By default the app will install into a `C:\DOSBox` folder.

## Project Evergreen
Project Evergreen AppTracker does not provide information and sources for installers for this app when last checked.


## EXE based installer

We install two components.

First install DosBox.  Then the target app is installed (unpacked) and we configure DosBox to automatically start the app in the DOS Autoexec.bat file.

The DosBox installer adds extra shortcuts we want to remove for production.  For extra credit, you change the DosBox shortcut to use an appropriate application icon and name.

## SilentInstallHQ
Silent Install HQ currently provides no information on the silent install of this app.

## Typical Configuration Items 

This identifies the most commonly interesting configuration items in the application.

* The product does have an autoupdater.  Like they didn't even exist back then.  We didn't have the internet of today, just dial-up modems to usenet.

## Installed Components worth noting

* The DosBox application installs with two shortcuts and we remove one. 
* AppData folders are not used as they didn't exist back then.
