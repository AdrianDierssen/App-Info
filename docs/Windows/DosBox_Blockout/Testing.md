# Testing DosBox plus Blockout

The following tests should be considered to determine the application fidelity when repackaging.

* One shortcut should be present.
* Launch the app.  DosBox should load and automatically start the game.
* Play the game.  Have some fun, but remember that you are at work (see `Personal Note 1`)!

`Personal Note 1`: I once hired a team of five people to play video games all day. This was back when we were SoftwareWOW, (which later turned into Softricity and was bought/renamed to Microsoft App-V).  We sent a young woman to drive up to the loading docks of nearby businesses to recruit them. This was back in 2000, and I needed testers that could get to level 23 of the hardest games of the day, like RealPlayer, to be sure they worked OK when streamed.  I didn't hire you. So get back to work!  - Tim
