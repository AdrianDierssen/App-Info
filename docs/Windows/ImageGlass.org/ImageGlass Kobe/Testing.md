# Testing ImageGlass

The following tests should be considered to determine the application fidelity when repackaging.

* One shortcut should be present (assuming extra was removed).
* Launch ImageGlass app from shortcut.  
* Ensure no updates are detected, but expect to be prompted to configure.
* Change a setting, close the app and repopen, check that setting is sticky.
