# Testing IrfanView

The following tests should be considered to determine the application fidelity when repackaging.

* One shortcut should be present (assuming extra was removed).
* Launch IrganView app from shortcut.  Check any options preset by installer.
* Optional: If plugin added, verify it is present (settings/Preferences->PlugIns)
* Verify that you can make a Preferences change and it is sticky.
* From in the program, open a file from a network share.
* Use an FTA to open into IrfanView.
