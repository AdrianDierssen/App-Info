# Packaging ACDC (V2) for App-V

This app is easily packaged for App-V.

* No special App-V tricks are needed.
* You might want to add a shortcut, but hide it in a lesser viewed folder of the start menu (such as Windows Accessories) on Windows 7.  On Windows 10 you might use a less interesting name.


Testing on Windows 7/10/11 indicates [<img src="/media/CatFullFidelity.png" alt="Full Fidelity" />](/media/CatFullFidelity.png) support of the app.
