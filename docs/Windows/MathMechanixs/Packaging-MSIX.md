# Packaging Math Mechanixs for MSIX

The app has been packaged in MSIX both with and without the PSF.
* The PSF Launcher is required for file and url based shortcuts, however you might not want those anyway.
* Other PSF components are not required for this app as tested, however the FRF may prove to be needed in certain situations.


Testing on Windows 10/11 indicates [<img src="/media/CatFullFidelity.png" alt="Full Fidelity" />](/media/CatFullFidelity.png).
