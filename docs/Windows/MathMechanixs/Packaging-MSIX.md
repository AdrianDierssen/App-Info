# Packaging Math Mechanixs for MSIX

The software was packaged on Windows 10 21H2 using Microsoft MSIX Packaging Tool 1.2022.330 both with and without the PSF using TMEditX.
* The PSF Launcher is required for file and url based shortcuts, however you might not want those anyway.
* Other PSF components are not required for this app as tested, however the FRF may prove to be needed in certain situations for UAT not caught in a smoke test.


Testing on Windows 10/11 indicates ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Full%20Fidelity-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge).
