<img src="/media/AppIcons/MATHMECHANIXS-256.png" align="left" height="256" alt="Math Mechanixs logo"  /> Math Mechanixs is a general purpose math software we commonly see used in Univesity classroom settings.  The original software was from 2006 and graphics might look a bit dated as the authors focused on adding more advanced math calculations.

The Lite version is free, the full version is licensed.


This Readme.md is the high level file that describes the application summary.  Additional documentation files may also be present to cover specific scenarios, such as repackaging into a specific format. See the file list in this folder.

This is where to list a summary of known success (or not) in repackaging info certain formats.  If repackaging the application is not straightforward, a specific documentation file covering the details for that repackaging format is suggested. Values in the Success field are somewhat subjective, but we recommend that the summary use the following value:

* ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Full%20Fidelity-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge) - App appears to be completely functional.
* ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-High%20Confidence-green?style=for-the-badge) - There may be a small loss in functionality, but most companies will be OK with deploying this form.
* ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Mostly%20Works-yellow?style=for-the-badge) - A loss in functionality that likely makes this a bad way to deploy.
* ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Major%20Issues-critical?style=for-the-badge) - Application is known to not work in this form (so far).
* ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Unknown%2FUntested-lightgray?style=for-the-badge) - No information is available.
