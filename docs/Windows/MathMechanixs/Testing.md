# Testing Math Mechanixs

The following tests should be considered to determine the application fidelity when repackaging.

* Verify number of shortcuts present (6, unless some were removed).
* Lauch primary app.
* * If not preconfigured via ini, there will be first time EULA, Tutorial, Update Check, and TipOfTheDay
* * If preconfigured, there should be no EULA, Tutorial, Updates, or TipOfTheDay.
* * Save a file (It saves as .mtx), probably to the desktop.
* * Change a setting, close and reopen the app and verify the change sticks.
* * Verify the FTA (.mtx)
