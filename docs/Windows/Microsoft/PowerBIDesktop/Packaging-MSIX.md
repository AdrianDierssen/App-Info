# Packaging Power BI Desktop for MSIX

The app has been packaged in MSIX without the PSF.  Adding the PSF to this app causes a CLR issue, so best to avoid. 


Testing on Windows 10/11 indicates [<img src="/media/CatHighConfidence.png" alt="High Confidence" />](/media/CatHighConfidence.png).  This rating is given when the app is deployed without a license.  An error dialog appears on the first run, but appears to be benign and does not reappear.
