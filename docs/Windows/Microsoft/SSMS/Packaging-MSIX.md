# Packaging SSMS for MSIX

The app has been packaged in MSIX both with and without the PSF.
* The PSF Launcher, FRF, and EnvVarFixups are recommended.
* The launch of the primary app fails; possibly it still uses unsupported COM+.


Testing on Windows 10/11 indicates [<img src="/media/CatIssues.png" alt="Has Issues" />](/media/CatIssues.png).
