# Packaging Math Mechanixs for MSIX

The software was packaged on Windows 10 21H2 using Microsoft MSIX Packaging Tool 1.2022.512 both with and without the PSF using TMEditX.
* The PSF Launcher, FRF, and EnvVar fixups are suggested.
* There are a number of other changes needed that are not supported by the Microsoft MSIX Packaging tool, at least without manual editing of the AppXManifest (or using other tooling).


Testing on Windows 10/11 indicates ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Major%20Issues-critical?style=for-the-badge), however additional debugging is warrented.
