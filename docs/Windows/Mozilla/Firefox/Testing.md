# Testing Firefox

The following tests should be considered to determine the application fidelity when repackaging.

* One shortcut should be present.
* Launch FIrefox app from shortcut.  
* Ensure no updates are detected.  Resolve being the default either way.
* Use the Hamburger menu to access Settings.  Make a change, close, reopen, and make sure change sticks.
