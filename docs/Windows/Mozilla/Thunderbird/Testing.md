# Testing Thunderbird

The following tests should be considered to determine the application fidelity when repackaging.

* One shortcut should be present.
* Launch Thunderbird app from shortcut.  
* Ensure no updates are detected.  
* If a test email account is available, connect and send an email.
* Test out the mailto protocol handler integration:
* * Start a browser (other than edge) and type mailto:you@testdomain.com.  You should have an option use Thunderbird.
