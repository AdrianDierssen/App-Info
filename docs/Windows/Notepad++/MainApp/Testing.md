# Testing Notepad++

The following tests should be considered to determine the application fidelity when repackaging.

* One shortcut should be present.
* Launch app from shortcut.  
* * There should be no prompt for updater (however it may take at least 15 days after packaging)
* * Open an xml file.
* * Make a change.
* * Close.
* In a file explorer window, right click on any (non XML) file and verify that there is a Notepad++ menu item in the popup menu list.
