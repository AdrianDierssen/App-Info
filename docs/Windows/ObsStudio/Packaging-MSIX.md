# Packaging OBS Studio for MSIX

The software was packaged on Windows 10 21H2 using Microsoft MSIX Packaging Tool 1.2022.330 with or without PSF.
* The app appears to work without the PSF.
* For good meansure, using the PSF with FRF would be recommended as we suspect some files might get updated in production use.


Testing on Windows 10/11 indicates ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Full%20Fidelity-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge).
