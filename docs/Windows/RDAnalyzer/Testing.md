# Testing RDAnalyzer

The following tests should be considered to determine the application fidelity when repackaging.

* You must remote into a machine/VM using a supported remote protocol.  Note that remote desktop client software is OK, but a Hyper-V console is not.
* One shortcut should be present.
* Launch RemoteDesktopAnalyzer from shortcut.
