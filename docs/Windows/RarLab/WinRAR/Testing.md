# Testing WinRAR

The following tests should be considered to determine the application fidelity when repackaging.

* One shortcut should be present, assuming other 3 removed.
* Launch App. 
* * Check any preconfiguration if added during packaging.
* * Change a setting.  Close/reopen, check if sticky. 
* Verify FTA for .zip added WinRar to the list.
* Right-click on any regular (non zip) file to test for Context Menu.
* Drop a file onto an existing .RAR file and ensure it is added.
* If in a Sharepoint environment, open an archive from the share, change it and verify the changed version is updated in Sharepoint.
