# Packaging Sigil for MSIX

The app has been packaged in MSIX with the PSF FileRedirectionFixup.
* After install, remove second shortcut for uninst000.
* PsfLauncher is required as is the FRF.


Testing on Windows 10/11 indicates [<img src="/media/CatHighConfidence.png" alt="High Confidence" />](/media/CatHighConfidence.png).  The application prompts for updates.  It might be possible to overcome by adding a configuration file to LocalAppData\sigil-ebook\sigil
